# Crime-Reporting-System

We have designed a web application called the Online Crime Reporting System using PHP with the aim of providing accessible crime management solutions such as filing FIR and checking its status for everyone. The website has four functionalities, which includes:

1. Login pages for four types of users: Users, Police In Charge, Station In Charge, and Police Headquarters.
2. Users can register and login to file a complaint using their Aadhar card.
3. The complaint is assigned randomly to a police officer from the nearest police station.
4. The police officer can update the status of the case from the police login portal, such as FIR filed, criminal identified, criminal caught, etc.
6. The Police Headquarters portal allows adding police stations to different areas and viewing all the cases.
